        Santa Claus (Saint Nicholas) is thought of mainly as the jolly man in
        red who brings toys to children on Christmas Eve.

      <h3>
        The real Santa Claus is inspired by monk named St. Nicholas, living near
        Myra in Turkey back in 280 A.D. He was known for giving away all of his
        inherited wealth helping the poor and sick.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The name Santa Claus evolved from Nicholas' Dutch nickname,
        <a href="#" class="text-link"><strong>Sinter Klaas</strong></a>. End of 18th century a <em>New York newspaper</em> 
        reported that groups of Dutch families had gathered to honor the
        anniversary of his death. In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed
        money to pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy
        families. They began dressing up men in Santa Claus suits and sending
        them into the streets of <a href="#" class="text-link"><strong>New York</strong></a> to solicit donations.

        However, for most parts of the country, Christmas is only at the
        beginning of the period when it's likely to snow. It is more likeley to
        see snow between January and March than in <a href="#" class="text-link"><strong>December</strong></a>. White Christmas was
        more frequent before the change of calendar in 1752 which brought
        Christmas Day back by 12 days. Climate change has also brought higher
        average temperatures and this generally reduced the chances of a white
        Christmas. The <a href="#" class="text-link"><strong>forecast</strong></a> can accurately measure if snow
        is likely on Christmas Day <em>up to five days beforehand</em>.
